        timezone: "Europe/Oslo"
        note: "Re-validate now from reputable macro/sector/company sources."
      bullets:
        - topic: "Rates & inflation regime"
          statement: "Disinflation is progressing but central banks are cautious; policy rates have been on hold after earlier cuts (e.g., Fed holding ~3.50–3.75%; ECB deposit rate ~2.0%; UK base rate ~3.75%); inflation prints/projected paths differ by region, with services inflation and wage dynamics still watched closely."
        - topic: "Growth outlook"
          statement: "Global growth is generally described as 'resilient but fragile', with material downside risks from geopolitics and trade-policy uncertainty; Europe’s outlook is modest vs the US, with forecasting bodies expecting only low-to-mid single-digit real GDP growth rates in many advanced economies."
        - topic: "Enterprise IT spend"
          statement: "2026 IT spending forecasts emphasise strong growth driven by AI infrastructure, data centres, and software even as some categories remain cyclical; AI-related capex and modernisation are central to CIO agendas."
        - topic: "AI/cloud demand & monetisation"
          statement: "Narrative has shifted from pilots to scaling/production; providers highlight 'advanced AI' embedded across offerings, with attention to tangible bookings/revenue, pricing, and delivery productivity."
        - topic: "Discretionary vs mandatory spend"
          statement: "Clients remain cost- and efficiency-focused; discretionary project spend can be muted while large transformation programmes (digital core, ERP modernisation, cloud, security, operating model change) continue where ROI is clear."
        - topic: "Public sector, defence, sovereignty"
          statement: "Europe is in a multi-year defence and security investment upcycle; public-sector modernisation and cyber/sovereignty themes are seen as more resilient demand pockets for many European services firms."
        - topic: "Energy transition & infrastructure"
          statement: "Clean energy and grid investment remain structurally high; data-centre buildouts and power constraints create engineering/infrastructure consulting tailwinds alongside energy-transition compliance and delivery work."
        - topic: "Labour market & delivery capacity"
          statement: "Wage/attrition pressures have eased from peaks but talent, utilisation, pyramid/offshore mix, and AI-enabled productivity remain key margin swing factors."
        - topic: "Investor focus in 2025‑26 calls"
          statement: "Bookings/order intake, backlog and book-to-bill, pipeline quality, margin resilience vs pressure, cash conversion/working capital, and capital returns (dividends/buybacks/M&A discipline)."
        - topic: "Valuation pitfalls emphasised"
          statement: "Headline earnings can be distorted by business optimisation/restructuring, seasonal working capital swings, legal/court one-offs, segment reclassifications/discontinued ops, and accounting effects (lease liabilities, pensions, capitalised development costs). You must normalise and show sensitivity."
